        <div class="subheading mb-5">UCR Psychology Undergraduate StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jon Satumbaga I am a current undergraduate student at the University of California Riverside studying Psychology. I was born in San Diego, CA and grew up both there and Chula Vista, CA. Prior to attending UCR I attended Otay Ranch High School and graduated in the year 2013. When I graduated from high school I decided to attend UCR. Psychology was one of the majors I was interested in and the one I applied to here. Other majors I considered taking up were Marine Biology and Computer Engineering. Currently I am a third year Psychology student and plan to be graduating next school year, 2021.<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve worked three job up to this point of my life. The first job I had was in 2013 which I held for three years. I worked as a bagger at the Commissary on a military base: Marine Core Air Station Miramar. My job consisted of bagging up customerâ€™s groceries, assisting them to their care and loading it into their care if needed. In my opinion this was my least favorite job but worked as for a first job. My next job was a seasonal job in 2017. I worked at Vans as a sales associate at the Vans store in the Tyler Galleria. Most of the time I was on the shoe deck selling shoes but I occasionally helped out around the skate are where we sold skateboards. This job had a great worker discount that I wish I still had. My most current job which I am still currently working at is a store associate at In N Out Burger in Moreno Valley. So far I have enjoyed my time with the company.<br><br>

        I have a few hobbies that enjoy that include skateboarding, doodling, cooking and playing pool. I actually didnâ€™t pick up skateboarding until coming to UCR. I had a mutual friend who joined Skate Club at UCR and was invited to join the club with her. Since then I learned how to skate kind of and hold an officer spot for the club. I also have designed three of our club t-shirts which Iâ€™m pretty proud of. Which brings me to my next hobby which is doodling and design. I am not the best drawer but, I do like to try. I doodle pretty much every day for fun and it is something Iâ€™d like to practice and become better at. I also find design/graphic design very interesting which I kind of wish now I could also go to school for. I enjoy cooking and watching cooking related TV shows and YouTube videos. When I have the time I try to recreate recipes that I have seen that pique my interest.  Lastly up until quarantine came up I started to learn to play pool with two of my friends. We had played pretty much every day and the end of our days at the habit. Another thing I to do is play the video games I currently play on a roommateâ€™s xbox but plan on building a pc in the future. I also like to play Pokemon GO when Iâ€™m not at home I still find it fun and I have friends who also still play the game too.
